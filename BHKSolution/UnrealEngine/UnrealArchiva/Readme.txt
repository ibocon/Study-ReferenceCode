Thank you for purchasing Landscape Auto Material!

Landscape Auto Material (LAM) is a flexible autopainting material for Unreal Engine 4 Landscape 
component. When you are drawing the topology of your landscape, proper material layers are 
drawn automaticaly. 

The package includes production-quality assets: realistic grass, translucent water with 
distortion and caustics, 7 tree types, 6 types of bushes, 5 types of flowers, 3 different 
stones and a blowball effect. A sample scene to get started is also included in the bundle.


Material basics:

1. Add Landscape Auto Material package to your project

2. Duplicate the master material instance Landscape_Automaterial_Inst from Content / LandscapeAutoMaterial / Materials / LandscapeAutoMaterial

3. Apply a copy of instance to your Landscape actor in the Level

4. Set up a GlobalScale parameter in a material instance suitable for your landscape size

5. If you want to use additional weighted-blended layers: paint all the landscape using layer "Auto"
nothing seems happened but it is difficult for proper weighted-blend working

5. Done!
